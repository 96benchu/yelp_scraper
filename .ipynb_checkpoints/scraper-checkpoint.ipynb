    "* Custom Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "For the NYT example, since it is a publicly visible page we did not need to authenticate. HTTP basic authentication isn't too common for consumer sites/applications that have the concept of user accounts (like Facebook, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.) but is simple to setup quickly and you often encounter it on with individual password protected pages/sites. I'm sure you have seen this before somewhere:\n",
    "\n",
    "![http-basic](http://i.stack.imgur.com/QnUZW.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Cookie based user login is what the majority of services use when you login with a browser (i.e. username and password). Once you sign in to a service like Facebook, the response stores a cookie in your browser to remember that you have logged in (HTTP is stateless). Each subsequent request to the same domain (i.e. any page on `facebook.com`) also sends the cookie that contains the authentication information to remind Facebook's servers that you have already logged in.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many ReST APIs however use OAuth (authentication using tokens) -- either OAuth 1.0 or OAuth 2.0 (Yelp uses 1.0) -- which can be thought of a programmatic way to \"login\" _another_ user. Using tokens, a user (or application) only needs to send the login credentials once in the initial authentication and as a response from the server gets a special signed token. This signed token is then sent in future requests to the server (in place of the user credentials). From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OAuth):\n",
    "\n",
    ">  OAuth provides to clients a \"secure delegated access\" to server resources on behalf of a resource owner\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, an application built on top of the Yelp API has its own accounts that are distinct from Yelp's user accounts, even though one person owns both accounts. In this sense, the API can be thought of a way for a \"guest\" application to access Yelp user data. And now hopefully authentication with OAuth makes a little more sense.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tradeoff of security is one of convenience and to use OAuth we need to authenticate the requests we will send by _signing_ them with our keys. But thankfully many libraries exist to make working with OAuth much more developer friendly. And many providers have their own wrapper libraries (including Yelp). Also, one of ways you can keep these keys private while still somewhat convenient to use programmatically is to store them in environment variables or an external file outside of version control (this has the nice side effect that your code can also work in a remote execution environment like the autograder).\n"

For that we need to turn to web scraping, but to find out what pages to scrape we first need to parse our JSON from the API to extract the URLs of the restaurants.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we already have the results as Business objects (since we are using the Yelp client), this is not a general solution and many APIs don't have a nice wrapper library in your language of choice. Also, it is a best practice to seperate the act of __downloading__ data and __parsing__ data. This ensures that your data processing pipeline is modular and extensible (and autogradable ;). This decoupling also solves the problem of expensive downloading but cheap parsing (in terms of computaion and time)."

Having eaten here numerous times now, I can give it my legit stamp of approval, and this review hah. \\xa0I am enamored, yes I said it, by the whole experience of eating here. See, I lived in Mexico many moons ago and eating street tacos is an ADL - activity of daily living (common medical abbreviation). So yea I get a dose of nostalgia here, but their food is the reason I keep coming back and what I think about after I leave. As in previous reviews, the options are standard- chicken, bistec, barbacoa, pork. What they do that's special, that I haven't had elsewhere, is that they season their meat quite substantially using more than just salt and pepper. Their chicken meat is made with caramelized onions. Their barbacoa is ready to eat with a plate of rice if you choose- it's that flavorful on its own. You see the pics of their condiments, which are all you can add. There's the salsas of various kinds, including avocado and haba\\xf1ero (which is not dumbed down at all!). There's the fresh chopped veg toppings and grilled chiles if you're lucky. The final product of your ultimate choice is incredibly delicious, not to mention filling. I've had 2 tacos and been full, 3 and really full. You pay for however many tacos you want inside the grocery store, $2.50 each, the cashier will give you a ticket of your quantity. You take it outside and hand it to the kind sir who will prepare your bounty. You can eat right there on plastic disposable plates covered in wax paper- they use plastic bags in MX. Or take it home, which I've done as well, and enjoy a less warm but still delish meal. The tacos are large, 2 of them fill a plate. It's an incredible meal at the cheapest of prices. The grocery store has authentic goods from their homeland, mainly food items but they also carry fresh meat and pi\\xf1atas, just in case. So back to being en enamorado- to eat these incredible tacos on the street, with paisanos, listening to tejano or mariachi tunes, for me can't be beat.\",\n",

I think my total time in line was 12 minutes, I went around 12:30 on a Tuesday... but now that I think about it... classes are done for the majority of students in the area so I'm not sure how the line is normally. My favorite part about Las Palmas is the condiment bar... I LOVE cilantro!!!!! And guac!!!! I also love not having to pay extra for these things. Although it wouldn't have been terrible considering the tacos are only 2.50 each. Only complaint is that I am short and was not able to really view the meats before selecting. But sadly I'm used to my height challenged-limitations. Perhaps a dry erase/chalk board with the days features? \\xa0Also, would like there to be more vegetarian options! But all in all, seriously, this place is amazing, you will not be disappointed!\",\n",

       "  'text': u'For the first timers- walk past the taco stand outside and into the market, pay for the food, make your way back outside, hand over your receipt, pick your meat, then prepare yourself to devour into your taco(s)!You get a massive taco for $2.50! I was like \"shoot, I refuse to ever pay less than $5 bucks at a taco spot\" so I got 3 tacos. I think I would have done just fine with just one. The tortillas that they use here are bigger than the usual palm-sized ones you find in other taco spots. And boy do they make sure to fill the sucker up! I had a hard time choosing which meat I wanted. Unfortunately for me, I didn\\'t get our meat cooked upon request so I chose based on which looked the freshest. I got the carne asada, al pastor, and the fajita mix. Carne asada tasted a bit bland for me. Thankfully I got a little too happy at the toppings bar (as I always do) so the sauce covered it up. The al pastor was delicious! When you have grease running down your fingers, you know that\\'s a tasty al pastor! The fajita mix was better than I thought it would taste. The onion & peppers definitely brought out a special charm in that taco. I\\'m a slow eater; so with the size of the taco and massive toppings/sauce on it, it gets soggy fast. Have a fork handy in case your tortilla rips like mine. Also there is no place to eat your taco there. You gotta either find yourself a spot on the curb or prepare to use your car trunk. Las Palmas is smart. They get free promotion/advertisement with people standing around eating their tacos throughout the street. I had 3 random people come up to me and ask what I was eating.',\n",

       "  'text': u\"I finally tried Las Palmas this weekend, and it lived up to its excellent reputation! It was unseasonably cold, so there wasn't any sort of a line out front. My boyfriend and I walked right in and paid for three tacos each at the counter before being served outside.As stated in other reviews, the tacos cost $2.50 each and are very generous. You get unlimited toppings (salsas, hot sauces, onions, cilantro, etc) from the topping bar. We sampled the lamb and the shredded BBQ beef. The beef was my favorite, since the flavor was richer and it was easier to eat. The lamb was a bit fattier and more chunky, but still very good. I was hungry but not overly so, and two tacos with a beer back at home were quite filling enough for me. I could see myself eating three after a long run or a hard workout. I can't wait to come back...most likely next weekend!\",\n",

       "  'text': u\"Visits: Once, for lunch.Food: So, everyone says that this place is amazingly authentic and incredibly spicy and flavorful. Now, I've never been to Mexico, so I can't comment on the authenticity. But in terms of spicy and flavorful? Not to me. In terms of flavor other than spicy heat, the whole business tasted pretty bland, from the shredded beef to the salsa to the thin and runny avocado paste. The corn tortillas were presumably relatively freshly made, but had the texture and flavor of stale cornbread crossed with dry cardboard. The only flavor that really reached my taste buds was a mild sweetness, and that's not my cup of tea. One point off.Also, I've got to mention this simply because so many people hyped up this place's red hot habanero sauce to me before I went, including a lot of reviews here. I've never, ever thought of myself as having a high tolerance for spiciness (I usually eat pretty bland, IMO!), but I slathered over a full ladle on each taco. I could taste the heat, sure. But it was pretty mild - I didn't even feel like I needed to drink water. Now, I will say that the people I went with thought I had an insane poker face. They put half as much on theirs and ended up sweaty, red-faced, and teary-eyed, so maybe I'm the weird one. Still, if a place is known primarily for spiciness, I'm going to expect that I'll personally be blowing smoke out my nose and ears. One point off.Atmosphere: It's a dinky little stand outside, the only one of its kind on the block. If half the block were stands, that wouldn't be a problem, but it's not like that, so it feels a little strange. Trash cans were piled high, and maybe it's because it's Oakland and college students are inane, but trash was piled high on the sidewalk near it, too! Gross. Also, there's no such thing as seating, so people were just standing around with their food, trying not to make eye contact. Not the most fun way to spend a lunch. Given that it's a street stand, any single thing could've been excused. However, all of them combined = point off.Service: It's self-service. No complaints.Price: It's really cheap, to the point where even though the food is mediocre, it was worth the price. I mean, it'd probably cost more to cook it from scratch, even if you did own all the spices and bought in bulk prices. So that's unusual.Overall, the price is great but the food is low on flavor, regardless of authenticity.\",\n",

Like, as someone conditioned to paying extra for guac at Chipotle, I'm pretty happy with unlimited amounts of slightly more goopy guac here. - Each taco is only $2.50. But let's be real, the base price is more like $5 for two tacos because who comes here and just gets one taco?

       "  'text': u'Being a Mexican-American visitor from San Diego in sunny Cali (where there\\'s a Mexican place every other half mile) and a constant visitor to Tijuana, there seem to be few places here in Pittsburgh that don\\'t try to be \"Americanized\" Mexican places. But with this place, I can definitely say Pittsburgh can be proud to have a place that provides to them the deliciousness that is authentic street tacos. Street tacos normally come in small tortillas (common for Tijuana street cart tacos, with a few here and there that try to be different). For 2.50 here though, you get a more filling and larger taco with different choices of carne o pollo, cilantro, cebolla, sal, limon y rica salsa en dos tortillas de maiz!Sorry, the enthusiasm got the better of me. Seriously though, this place really provides a great choice for authentic Mexican tacos for those southwestern transplants and Latin people who miss a little bit of home. And the locals here in Pittsburgh can enjoy what we\\'ve had for a good part of our lives. It may not be the perfect taco, but it might be as good as you can get here (and it\\'s very good!).',\n",

I haven't had tacos anywhere near this good since moving back from NYC, and now I'm obsessed. Yesterday after a long bike ride that landed us at REI in South Side Works, we decided we needed these tacos, and went the extra few miles (up hill) to get them. Mind you, he was out of all the usually choices (carnitas, barbecoa, stewed chicken, carne asada, etc...) and only had some sort of 'whatever was left over' mixture of chicken chunks, pork remnants, and select veggies - I was skeptical... but it still was amazing! I've always found the true sign of a good cook is being able to make the crappiest ingredients still into something delicious, and this dude does. Seriously, good stuff.

First off as soon as I got here some of the sauces didn't have lids on them and had flies ALL over them, I thought this was pretty gross but decided to still get some tacos and just use a sauce that had a lid on it. I thought the sauces looked pretty gross but thought at least the guy is watching over the meat, then I see him get a phone call and touch his phone with the gloves he was wearing and then go back to touching the food. For some reason I decided to look the other way when it came to this, maybe because I was incredibly hungry and needed to eat something asap. To top it off I go inside and look at the pan dulce, thinking oh at least this is in the store and enclosed, then I see a fly... Followed by about 10 other flies landing on pretty much every piece of bread they had in there. This is absolutely disgusting on many levels, and I don't know if Pittsburgh just doesn't have many Mexican options but this is totally unacceptable and I don't know how this place has a good rating let alone decent reviews.

You can order as many tacos as you want (though three makes for a heavy meal), with as many toppings at you want. Let me repeat, FOR $2.50. I want to emphasize that the appeal does not lie only in the price. I'm unashamed to say Las Palmas has made up a considerable part of my diet for the past year, and I've consistently been impressed by the freshness and quality of the ingredients. I suggest mixing it up - try a different meat for each taco base (there's usually a selection of 5-6), and challenge your taste buds with their range of salsas and fresh toppings. Brace yourself, they mean business with the spicy salsas. Warning - It's a stand, not a restaurant, and offers no seating, so you'll have to take your tacos on the go. But despite being covered by only a small awning, Las Palmas is opened year round. (Yes, even when Pittsburgh becomes an arctic wasteland.) Overall: believe the hype.

       "  'text': u\"There have not been super good tacos on Atwood Street since La Fiesta closed. \\xa0(Sorry, Mad Mex.) \\xa0Thankfully, Las Palmas is here to save the day and provide the East End with excellent and inexpensive tacos. \\xa0This taco stand is just as amazing as the one in Brookline. \\xa0I recently went by a 50-degree late Sunday afternoon and there was quite the line. \\xa0The only downside is that there aren't any nearby benches, but if you can manage to wait for a few minutes, it's a quick walk to Schenley Park.The store has a great selection of Mexican condiments, beverages, pastries, and fresh produce. \\xa0It's smaller than the store in Brookline, but would be a great place for students to shop--it's on par with what Groceria Merante is for Italian food.PRO TIP: You pay for your tacos inside the store and then they give you a receipt to take outside.\",\n",

       "  'text': u\"Street tacos cooked and served the way you'd expect street tacos to be cooked and served. This vendor is located just outside a grocery store with a large grill and small buffet table. Head inside and pick out a beverage and then tel the clerk how many tacos you want. $2.50 per taco is an outrageously good deal. Top it off by getting unlimited toppings for your taco at the buffet stand. We got steak and chorizo tacos and both were great. There were other fillings as well, including chicken and tongue. This is probably a four star joint but gets the fifth star for its cost effectiveness as well as the fact that I could slather my tacos with pico de gallo and a creamy guacamole, too. Worth your trip off the beaten path and enjoy these tacos. Pro tip: bring some tortilla chips and sample some of the salsas.\",\n",

       "  'text': u\"I ordered the steak, chicken, and chorizo tacos. Overall, they were simple, authentic, and fresh; it is comparable to Southern California Mexican tacos. The corn tortillas were a bit dry (I may have gotten some old ones), and there were two per taco (which I think is excessive). As for the meats, the steak could be more rare (mine were well done), but was seasoned nicely. The chicken was tender, but could use a little more salt. The chorizo was quite spicy and overpowers all the other meats. I would recommend eating it last to fully taste the quality of the other tacos.There is a nice large bar to the side, but unfortunately didn't have guacomole. For $2.50 per taco, I would say they are a bit pricy. Best Mexican food I have had in Pittsburgh so far.\",\n",

Pay inside the store and they will give you a receipt to hand to the people operating the taco stand outside. Pick your meat, which will then be placed on an incredibly fresh corn tortilla, load up your tacos with some condiments and salsa, and enjoy.When you finish stuffing that last meat filled corn tortilla into your face, you'll realize that you will be back again and again to repeat your newfound feeding ritual.Grab a Mexican soda from the fridge inside to wash down the meaty goodness.\",\n",

       "  'text': u\"If you love authentic tacos, Las Palmas is the best-kept secret in all of Pittsburgh. It's actually a taco stand in front of a tiny, genuine Mexican grocery on Atwood Street. The tacos are $2.50 each and probably the best you'll find in a city that is not known for its Mexican cuisine. You can pile on as many toppings as you want. For a sweet treat, pick up some flan or tres leches cake in the store. Delicious! My only complaint is there's nowhere to sit, so you've got to either take the food home, walk over to Schenley Park, or eat it awkwardly while walking down the street. These tacos are so mouth-watering as to make the last option seem reasonable, so be careful -- especially with the hot sauce.\",\n",

It's $2.50 for one taco, so $5 for two tacos filled with your choice of meat and unlimited toppings. And trust me, they are super generous with the meat and you can go crazy with the toppings, so just two tacos can make a pretty satisfying lunch. My favorite is the steak and onions taco. The meat is fully seasoned and the double tortilla is nice and warm. Be careful with the different salsa though because some can be extremely spicy. Double check the spice level before you slather on the salsa. Overall, I highly recommend Las Palmas as a Mexican option for a mid afternoon snack or a quick lunch.\",\n",

       "  'text': u\"I was really excited to try the tacos here because of all the great reviews. At the same time, I was worried I'd set my expectations too high and would be disappointed. I am happy to say that I suffered no disappointment.I paid my $2.50 for a taco inside the grocery store, then returned outside. I did not experience any language barriers. After I chose my meat, the man placed a tortilla in the box and added a generous amount of carnitas. (Other choices included chorizo and chicken.) I saw him warming tortillas as I entered the store; the meat was already cooked. I then took my taco to the condiment station and added tomatoes, pico de gallo, cilantro, and guacamole. My spice tolerance is really low so I didn't try any of the salsas. I then walked for about five minutes before I ate, so the food wasn't hot.The tortilla alone is just a little crispy, thick, and delicious. The meat was tender, moist, and flavorful. There was a lot, especially considering the price. Usually, that wouldn't be a pro for me, but at the condiments bar, I was able to add a lot of vegetables, which really helped balance out the meatiness. Everything was fresh, and the guacamole was good as well. The pico de gallo was a little spicy (just bearable for me if I ate it along with everything else), and I actually enjoyed the kick it lent the taco (I usually avoid spice). Next time, I'll probably try some of the salsas. I also want to try the taco as soon as I add the toppings, when it's really warm. The tacos are a pretty great deal--I'd say two or three would do for a meal. I also took a quick look around the grocery store. It's small and really cramped. They have a lot of pantry items, some produce, and some bread.\",\n",

Choice of Steak/ground beef/Chicken/Chicken Fajitas with mix veg/Carnitas/shredded Beef!Tried all except ground beef..they were all to die for! The best part was they had a whole condiment stations where they had fresh tomatoes, onions, cilantro, mild salsa, habanero, spicy and hot salsa! It's hidden in the hood! Right outside of a Mexican convenient store! So a landmark in finding the place! The make it fresh right in front of u! And at $2 each, u can't go wrong!! I don't I will ever find anything better!!\",\n",

       "  'text': u\"Can we talk about how good these Tacos were?I mean, seriously, just for a second?Ok. Here's the skinny - You go into the Las Palmas Mexican Market, where you pay $2.50 per taco and hope they understand enough of you English to complete the transaction. You then come out to the street and get said taco(s). You then top them at the toppings bar (that was amazing), afterwards you ascend to a higher plane of taco existence.On a crowded street in Pittsburgh. A sunny Sunday afternoon. Standing around a tree. This was the environment in which I had the best taco I have pretty much ever had. It was perfect though and through. i had one chicken and peppers, the other steak peppers and onions. They were perfect. I will be going back many more times.I totally took the YELPers' collective advice on this one and was not disappointed. If you like eating amazing tacos on a sidewalk, its 5/5 - would taco again.\",\n",

       "  'text': u\"Look, I don't care what people say: this place is awesome. Am I biased for being Latino? Definitely. But this is good cheap food. Comparing this place to Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. is not fair. Because comparing the street food from any country versus an Americanized joint is unfair because it is not the same -nor it tries to be-. Not saying the competition is not good, just saying the style is different. The food is cheap (about two dollars per taco) made in front of you in the street. No sitting, just street food -may be that is why it is so cheap?-My favorites are tongue and rajas (potatoes, cream, and chiles which is a vegetarian option). They also make tamales, which are not necessarily the best tamales in the world but they are the standard tamales you find in any Latino grocery store.The meat section at the back certainly caters the Latino community -or those interested- as the cuts you find are the ones we constantly use, especially in Mexican cuisine.Other than that it is a small grocery store that has products from Latin america. COMMENT: they have fresh baked goods (pan dulce).\",\n",

AM. \\xa0HAPPY. \\xa0I remember a few weeks I went into Mad Mex and asked for their spiciest salsa. \\xa0On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 3. \\xa0:(Yinzers aren\\'t much into spicy food. \\xa0Everything here is either bland or toned down to meet the boring tastes of the locals. \\xa0But Las Palmas--they are authentic. \\xa0You can tell by the Mexican music and the real Mexican people that work there. \\xa0Not a single gringo working there. \\xa0I got a drink and paid for a couple of tacos inside before walking back out to get my street food. \\xa02.50 per taco, unlimited toppings at the salsa bar. \\xa0I asked the guy what the spiciest salsas were and he pointed me towards the orange (haberno) and red(some kind of hot pepper). \\xa0I slathered my tacos in the salsas, liberally applied pico, grabbed a few limes and a grilled pepper. \\xa0Then I walked down the road to enjoy my lunch. \\xa0What happened next was mouth blowing. I placed the taco in my mouth and took a bite. \\xa0Sheer pleasure. \\xa0After all the crappy Mexican food I\\'ve had here, this was a revelation. \\xa0The zing of the onions, the softness of the corn tortillas, the kick of the salsas. \\xa0I took another bite. \\xa0I was in heaven for a few seconds. \\xa0 Until my mouth exploded in FIRE and went to straight to hell. \\xa0Holy Jesus! \\xa0If Satan made a salsa, the habenero would be it. \\xa0It was so sinful. \\xa0My face started to burn up and snot began to drip uncontrollably out my nostrils. \\xa0I must have looked like a disaster. \\xa0I polished off my first taco but had to pick at my second because I was hyperventilating like no ones business. \\xa0I downed my Jumex juice in a matter of seconds and then sprinted to the nearest store to buy a much needed bottle of water. \\xa0OMG OMG OMG. \\xa0So much pain and pleasure at the same time. \\xa0On a scale of 1 to 10, habenero salsa here is a 9.3. \\xa0Hopefully I do not diarreah later tonight.',\n",

Las Palmas has everything from chicken to beef to barbacoa and I'm probably missing some options. It's $2.50 for a taco. $2.50?!?!?! Do you realize how ridiculous that is??? You walk up to the grill on the sidewalk and tell them what kind of meat you want. They then take raw meat, slap it on the grill, cook it in front of you, and then hand it to you in a corn tortilla. You then have the option of slathering as many different toppings on the tacos as you please. I would say a meal is 2 tacos and they have really cool drinks inside to choose from. From coconut juice to various kinds of Mexican sodas. \\xa0As a student, I walked. And I can see it being a bit hard to find parking around there. Las Palmas is my little piece of Los Angeles.

It was cool finally finding the other latinos in the city, since 50% of the customers were clearly immigrant laborers having their weekend lunch out.

       "  'text': u\"OK!Here's the skinny. These are my favorite tacos in town. They provide you with two corn tortillas and your choice of meat and from there you have the ability to select toppings from the topping bar including: habenero sauce, red sauce, green sauce, an avacado sauce, pico de gayo, tomatoes, onions, cilantro and lime. \\xa0The meat changes daily and typical consists of ribeye, chicken, beef, chili pork or chorizo. There really isn't anywhere to eat, but you can always pop a squat on one of the many door stoops right there on Atwood Street. I've done it many times without any complaints so far. Just watch out for broken glass on the street!\",\n",

Outside on the sidewalk, during select hours, they run a small taco cart with pork and beef options. Each taco consists of two corn tortillas with a generous helping of meat, and then you get to add your own toppings and salsas. No vegetarian options here, and nowhere to sit outside. Most people seem to just stand around on the sidewalk and eat.The tacos are cheap and authentic. It's definitely a hole in the wall experience, but quite tasty.\",\n",

       "  'text': u\"This place has legit street tacos. It's very similar to the stand in front of Reyna's. It is a small stand in front of a Mexican grocery. They have 6 different meats to choose from. We had the pulled pork, the chorizo, and the Carne Asada. All were excellent. They have a toppings bar with the usual street taco fare- fresh onions, cilantro, and 6 different salsas and pico. One of the salsa's had pomplano and was very tasty. If in Oakland on weekends, do yourself a favor and hit this stand. \\xa0Only open on weekends. FYI- They don't have any seating. Most of the clientele are locals like me who walk home to eat. But there are always a few apartments on Atwood for rent with steps out front that you can sit real quick and eat on the steps. No one bothers you. It's a laid- back, college vibe in this area. Cash only. Prices: $2.50/ taco but when you see the size of them you will understand. Parking tip: if Atwood has no parking, try one street over (Meyran) or York St.\",\n",

All of the tacos are $2 (not dirt cheap but they give you a nice-sized taco and lots of fixings). The guy is continually cooking the meat on the grill in front of you while he pumps out tacos and the meat is really fresh. Tacos are served in two corn tortillas, which he also grills right in front of you. I highly endorse the ribeye steak taco--- a slab of beef instead of more traditional chopped-up meat, with really great flavor. The chorizo taco is pretty good also.Even better, you put on your own toppings-- fresh pico, avocado-tomatillo salsa, red hot salsa, cilantro, onions, etc...I loved this place and would go here really often if I lived in this neighborhood.',\n",

Their tacos are amazing: ribeye and lengua are our favorites. Have some manzanita (Mexican Apple soda) with it and you're game.\",\n",

       "  'text': u\"This review is for the taco cart--muy delicioso! \\xa0As others have said, $2/taco is a steal--I ate 2 for lunch and was full until 7! \\xa0Yesterday they had chorizo, carne asada (beef), and lomo (tenderloin). \\xa0On Mondays and Thursdays they have beef tongue as well. \\xa0The toppings bar is totally what makes it--pico de gallo, salsa verde, a variety of hot salsas, guacamole sauce, and basically ever other topping you can imagine (except cotija--didn't see any cheeses but that was fine by me!). \\xa0The corn tacos themselves are great but the hefty portion of meat is a lot for them to hold--my second one tore after the chorizo juice soaked through. \\xa0Just be sure to bring a fork and grab some napkins! \\xa0There's not a designated sitting area but there's usually a crowd around there. \\xa0We took ours to go and then ate over by the Porch. \\xa0The cooks were very friendly and will put up with you trying to practice your Spanish if you're so inclined. \\xa0Voy a volver!\",\n",

I haven't been back since I became vegetarian and I have really missed it, but now I see that you can get tacos with potatoes. I will have to try that (or will stop being a vegetarian for some meals just so I can eat the tacos again).\",\n",

       "  'text': u'Best tacos I\\'ve had in Pittsburgh so far. Although I\\'m biased towards these little \"hole in the wall\" type eateries, you really can\\'t beat the taste or the price of Las Palmas. Up until a few weeks ago, I thought Reyna\\'s in the Strip District was the best. But I gotta say, there\\'s something about the corn tortillas that makes the taco taste so good. Like others have mentioned, it\\'s just a little food stand run by nice people in front of a mexican grocery store. You can get pork, ground beef, steak, chicken, and chorizo followed by some toppings of your choice. I like onion, cilantro, guac, and one of their hot sauces. Ain\\'t nothing fancy, but go for a taco and a jarritos soda, you won\\'t be disappointed :)',\n",

       "  'text': u\"The BEST authentic Mexican food that I have found so far in Pittsburgh. They bumped the price of the tacos up from $2 to $2.50, \\xa0but it's well worth the extra .50. The staff has never been anything but friendly both inside and outside the store and they are willing to help with any questions you might have. For $5 you can get two filling tacos with a variety of meat choices including steak, shredded pork, chorizo, chicken, and ground beef. Be sure to ask for the freshly grilled corn tortillas to avoid any of the older tougher ones (which has only happened to me once). There is a toppings bar off to the side where you can pick from several standard toppings, which include: 3 types of salsa (I advise avoiding the deep red unless you chew on habanero peppers on a daily basis), guacamole, tomatoes, cilantro, lime, etc. There can be a short wait which can be avoided by not going between 12-2PM on the weekdays. Inside they sell great Mexican sodas and snacks. I would recommend eating the tacos immediately so that the yummy sauces don't make the tortilla soggy, but if you can't I've had them put the meat on the side of the tortillas so that I can eat it when I get home without worrying. No matter what time I go it's always worth the wait!\",\n",
